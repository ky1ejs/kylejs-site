# Personal

## In a few words

### Where I live 
ðŸ—½ NYC since "_Fall_" 2022.

### Where I lived prior
I spent my childhood in [Devizes, Wiltshire, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devizes). At 20 I moved to London for University and stayed there for 10 years before moving to NYC.

### My family
I live with my lovely wife [Sabrina](https://www.satti.photography/about) and our mini dachshund, [Parker](https://www.instagram.com/parker.dachshund/).

### Things I love
* **Photography** (we take a lot of photos of our mini dachshund, [Parker](https://www.instagram.com/parker.dachshund/))
* **3D Printing** â€“ my hobby since COVID lockdown. I print several things a year and love designing my own models.
* **Coffee** â€“ I'm a bit of a coffee snob, thanks to living with a Neapoliton for a few years in London.
* **Thoughtfully designed things** (e.g. watches or anything from Peak Design and Weber Workshops)
* **Anyone passionate about something**, (usually) no matter what that something is. Biographies are one of my favorite genres of content for this reason.
* **Coding** â€“ I love making projects on the side but never finish them, like most engineers.
* **Films**, although the Netflix era had me watching less and less overall.
* **Arsenal football club** â€“ I've loved football since I was young and owned an Arsenal season ticket for a year before moving to NYC, which I feel very lucky to have had.
