## Career in a (long) paragraph
I started out as an iOS engineer after being inspired to make apps by my Apple fan boy era (which included working at the Genius Bar). After my first engineering job in publishing, I joined an ex-Apple Store colleague's start-up as his first hire. This start-up grew for a few years and so did my role, eventually transitioning me into leading product development. This product experience really left a mark on me; I see myself as a Product Engineer and love to be at the intersection of product, design and engineering. A short time after the start-up went bust, I joined Spotify to build Podcast features. Shortly after joining Spotify, my team's needs changed and prompted me to move into web and backend development. Although Spotify hired me as an iOS engineer, I've probably done a sum total of ~9 months of iOS dev since joining them in 2019. I mostly love this because the iOS toolchain and ecosystem is quite the PITA.

## Spotify
I'm currently a Senior Engineer at Spotify. I've spent 2 years as an Engineering Manager here also (if you'd like to find out why I moved from a management role to an IC role, you can read <Link href="/posts/ic-to-em-and-back">this post</Link>).

I've had the fortune of working across many of Spotify's organizations:

1. **Core Experience** – working on podcast features in the mobile apps
2. **Audiobooks** – building the initial Audiobook offering
3. **Subscriptions** – focusing on converting users to Premium
4. **Platform** (_present_) – today I work in Spotify's Producitvity Engineering org

My time at Spotify has often involved creating new teams. In the moves I've made above, I've rarely joined an established team, often having to work with a new group to set a new rhythm and way of working that matches our team's chemistry, problem space and the organization we sit within.
