Writing is an incredibly important thing to practice. Frequent writing will help you think more clearly and maximise the rewards of endeavours you make.
    
When you can write well, you're more likely to communicate well in all forms and succeed in influencing others. The funny paradox about _living in the moment_ is that you're likely not to remember it. There's some truth to the whole "if there aren't any photos (or Instagram post), did it really happen". This is why I try to capture most things I do in some way.
