This year I achived a goal I've had for all of my adult life: to implement an intense fitness regime and build muscle.

In the last 6 months I've lost 10kg, built muscle and learned a lot about myself and my body. I've bullet pointed a lot of these learnings below.

My incredible coach, [Julian](https://www.instagram.com/julian.sollai/?hl=en), also shared some thoughts on this journey [here on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKckxLRRxU3/?img_index=3&igsh=MTZwdXJ3bjcyN2l3OQ==).

# Learnings
1. You either struggle now, or struggle later  – suffering is coming for you whether you like it or not. Realizing that it's better for me to build my body now and be ready for the challenges that will come was a huge unlock for me.
2. Pushing yourself hard at the gym builds resilience in all areas of your life – you will prove to yourself that you can endure great discomfort, which is going to be incredibly helpful through all walks of your life
3. 5am starts are awesome – I was so skeptical about getting up early for the gym, thinking I'd be too tired to carry out my day, but that wasn't the case. Getting gym out of the way, starting my day off me-vs-me and demonstrating to myself that I have the ability to push myself first thing in the morning sets the day up perfectly. Not to mention the gym is nice and quiet in the early hours...
4. It's about finding your level and pushing yourself... Turning up to the gym is already a win. I often set a bar in my head that I thought I had to achieve; lifting a certain weight, doing X number of reps... but really as long as you pushed your body as hard as it would go, it doesn't matter where it says no... you've just got to find your level and push yourself continually.
5. You can definitely do this while having a busy professional life, and odds are that it will actually help you perform better at that job
7. My cognitive ability improved over time as I started working out more 
8. Day to day utility of added strength is awesome
9. The gut/bowel movement issues I've had for several years have pretty much gone as a result of my improved diet, reduced stress and fitter body
10. Resetting your appetite by abstaining from heavy eating and indulgence in treats makes you appreciate the times you do treat yourself all the more. I had profound experiences in eating my favorite things during (by managing cals) and after the diet (e.g. burgers, pancakes, pastries)
11. You eventually get used to drinking 4L a day and now I find myself wanting at least 3L
12. Consistency is everything. Discipline is good but you have to break through the moments when you don’t want to do it. This may seem a bit "_tomato tomato_"... but think about being consistent... stack up consistent behavior week in week out... that’s what moves needles and makes progress.
13. Your body is an adaptation machine that wants to get to a state where it no longer needs to adapt. It’s kind of its own worst enemy; it wants you to be comfortable, but comfort won’t help it improve. When you make it uncomfortable, it’s incredibly good at finding comfort again and influencing you to stay there. You have to keep pushing into discomfort to take your results to the next level.
14. Greek yogurt, dark chocolate and frozen berries are goated
15. Hot sauce is goated - 0 calories!!!!!
16. Calming music can be helpful at the gym just as energy boosting music can be – when my body is feeling a lot of intensity, resetting your stress levels with calming music can be really helpful for me to focus on getting the lift done (my fave: *[true focus lies between rage and serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHksDAB9vOo)* )
17. It’s blissfully sobering to have a hard stop at the end of day because I have to get up for gym at 5am
18. It’s been easy to slip into worry about getting fatter now that I’ve reached this physique – I'm working on this
19. When you're traveling on a cut, focus on hitting your protein goal and make sure you feel a solid sense of hunger for a decent portion of the day. I took 3 long trips (Florida, Europe, Texas) over the program and didn still lost weight on all of them whilst having a few treats here and there.

# What did the regime look like?
Throughout the regime I worked out 4x a week from 1-1.5 hours. 80% of the time, I did my workouts at 5:30am before work.
## Month 1 – Conditioning
**Calories: 2450 (my maintenance)**

This month was all about getting my body used to the intensity and motions of the routine whilst getting into a nutrition habit.
## Month 2 to 4 – Cut stage 1
**Calories: 2200**

Intensity elevated in these months and we added 20 mins of cardio to the end of every workout (usually stairmaster... RIP).
## Month 5 
**Calories: 2000**

We're reaching the end of the cut so energy levels are starting to deplete as my body gets depleted of it. To manage this, we lowered the number of sets on many exercises to avoid injury. We also added more cardio – 25 mins after every workout. (yay).
In this month we also took a week long de-load as I was experiencing some trouble sleeping and stress levels at work were increased. We bumped my cals back up to 2200 to help me sleep and lowered intensity on some exercises.
## Month 6
**Calories: 1750 - 2000**

As the month went on we eventually lowered calories for the final push of the cut. 
For the last week or two we stopped taking lifts to failure to avoid injury.
# A thank you to Julian
I cannot thank [Julian](https://www.instagram.com/julian.sollai/?hl=en) enough for this experience... he turned out to be everything I'd hoped for and more in a coach and helped realize the potential within me.
Julian's thoughtful, holistic, compassionate yet driven approach is something I count myself as lucky to have experienced!
