## Summary
Writing is an incredibly important thing to practice. Frequent writing will help you think more clearly and maximise the rewards of endeavours you make.
    
When you can write well, you're more likely to communicate well in all forms and succeed in influencing others. 

## A few thoughts on capturing content in general
The funny paradox about _living in the moment_ is that you're likely not to remember it. There's some truth to the whole "if there aren't any photos (or Instagram post), did it really happen". 

I learnt this after spending a year of my life in my early 20s minimizing the amount of photos I took so that I could be more present. Although I did have some really great times, I can't really many remember them... capturing and reflecting on your experiences makes them 3x more rewarding. Sharing these memories and connecting with others over them makes them 10x more rewarding.

This is why I try to capture most things I do in some way.
