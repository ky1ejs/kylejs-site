# Summary
In 2023, 3.5 years after joining Spotify as an Individual Contributor (IC), I transitioned to a management role for the second time in my career. After 2 years in that Engineering Manager role, I’m transitioning back to being an IC. 

In this post I’m going to share my reasoning for moving back to IC both so I can revisit my current thinking in the future and for others considering the moves between IC and Manager roles. 


# What prompted my move back to EM?
**TL; DR; I founded an internal product that ended up being owned by an org that couldn’t justify having more EMs.**

In the new tech era of being ruthlessly efficient and having intense focus on the bottom line, being crystal clear on headcount needs and budget allocation is vital for org leaders.

In addition, after suffering a recent “reduction in force”, Spotify leaders are deeply concerned with ensuring that their orgs are optimally staffed to both meet there goals and ensure more layoffs don’t occur. This obviously includes being very critical of headcount additions.

The organization that has been chosen as the home for the product I founded has a sufficient amount of managers, so in order for me to stick with the work, I was asked to transition back to an IC role.

After one has founded a product, it might seem like an easy decision to follow it wherever it goes. However, there are a few trade-offs involved and it’s not exactly a low risk move.

# Risks of going back to IC from EM
## Risk 1. – No longer being invited to "[the room where it happens](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TK2KSrzXD6W01qjXVjNGh)"
At Spotify, one of the cool things about moving from \<\= Senior Engineer to Engineering Manager, which 99% of the time is a lateral move, is that you gain access to channels, meetings and discussions that only EMs, Staffs and a level or two above are invited to. 

This is excellent for gaining visibility, growing a network outside of your team and practicing your strategy and influencing skills.

**The risk**: As I move back to an IC role, I open myself up to no longer being invited to higher level strategic discussions, having decent opportunities to make new connections with leaders across the company and/or losing the visibility of senior leaders who can make future growth opportunities significantly easier to obtain (e.g. projects to drive, general involvement, direct visibility to others of contribution and behavior).

In the near term, as Tech Lead of the product I've founded, I'll continue to have influence and agency at a high strategic level. But whilst I remain at a Senior Eng title, I could lose this position at any point (e.g. if ownership is moved to a new org where a Staff Engineer is assigned to this Tech Lead position).

Some of you might immediately think that it would be unjust for me to lose the Tech Lead position of a product that I've founded, but in response to this I would offer two things:
1. **equity is not guaranteed** — don’t let yourself believe that the growth and recognition practices of any large corporation are grounded in equality and justice… even if you feel entitled to treatment with in an equitable way, the powers that be will frequently consciously and/or unconsciously bypass what is right/fair for what they perceive as the best path forward for the success of the business, managing their biases or not. 
2. **founders often leave** — the founders of many products all over the world have eventually been replaced by more experienced candidates as the product/company matures and requires more experienced leadership. Either the project could outgrow me, either in terms of scale or impact (big impact typically incentivizes leaders to out one of their Staff+ ICs at the helm, and those ICs typically want to work on those types of things for the exposure/impact), or a senior leader who doesn't have enough visibility into my skillset or contribution could simply prefer another Tech Lead over me. 
## Risk 2. – Potential for being made redundant by working on a fledgling product
The product I've founded has been very well received so far but has not as yet proven product market fit.
Should this product ultimately fail and we chose to use another for its purpose, what will happen to me? Will I be made redundant?

Pre-2023 I wouldn’t have been concerned about this, but as mentioned already in this post, the current tech climate shows that this is a very real concern today. 

Redundancy is particularly precarious for my case since I live in the US on a visa that depends on my employment at Spotify. As soon as that employment ends, my wife and I have 3 months to leave the country. 
# Rewards & opportunities of going back to IC from EM
## Benefit 1. – *the obvious one* – Visibility and impact in continuing to Tech Lead a new product
It's very rare that one gets the opportunity to found and build a significant product from scratch at a big tech company. I'm so deeply grateful for this opportunity and for each of the individuals that have been involved in getting it off the ground.

The product I've founded solves for immense pain that Spotify is experiencing in disseminating high level company goals and in carrying out a series dependency resolution and prioritization discussions.

This means that the project offers high visibility with senior leaders right across the company and will grow my network as result.

Whether or not my impact leads to new opportunities, a promotion, decent comp review or even just pats on the back, the network I've gained and the story I can now tell cannot be taken away.
## Benefit 2. – Greater job security
I know, I know... this one contradicts Risk number 2 above, but hear me out...

In my opinion, the title of Senior Engineer is one of the most safe roles at Spotify (provided you're making impact and receiving positive performance reviews, of course).

Why? It's the cheapest level at which the company receives an independent, experienced and action oriented individual that little input to create outsized impact.

In addition, with the advent of AI code writing assistants, the Senior Engineer is experienced enough to navigate the nuances baked into answers that AI tools give. In terms of output, I'd equate a *single experienced and high performing Senior Eng + AI* to at least 3 engineers of the level below, making them a better ROI for the company.

Jobs for Senior Engineer and Engineer II are probably the most common openings in engineering at Spotify, with an experienced Senior often being preferred due to their ability to onboard and make impact quickly.

As with most tech companies, the middle management layer at Spotify is being squashed. As a result, many engineers are taking on more reports and/or more teams then ever before, leading to lower headcount demands for the EM / SEM role.

From my perspective, should a high performing EM and a high performing Senior find themselves in a team and/or project that gets shut down, the Senior is more likely to find a quick transition into another role at Spotify.

## Getting back to being a builder
I generally think of the EM role at Spotify as having three main areas: people, delivery, strategy.

I like all three of these areas, but the one that lights me up the most is strategy. It's the closest to being part of the creation process of the EM facets. Closer still would be designing and writing software, which I'm hearing some whispers of EMs getting more involved in these days, but it's rare for EMs to get time to design systems or write code at Spotify.

However, strategy is the area that EMs of my seniority are least often involved in (depending on the area, chemistry, skillset of the EM and several other factors). EMs are guaranteed to have to handle people and most of the time handle delivery, but strategy is often taken on by their managers and skip managers.

Moving back to an IC role takes me closer to having direct contribution to the creation process.
