# Intro
Lay-flat portafilters are typically of interest to customers for their easier workflow. They donâ€™t tip over like non-lay-flat portafilters and they sit perfectly level on for distribution and tamping every time. No accidentally tripped out grounds, not delicate positioning on smaller scales to ensure they donâ€™t fall over.

# Options
If youâ€™re looking for a lay-flat portafilter for your Micra, some options include

| Brand           | Model                                                                                                     | Price | Compatibility                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weber Workshops | [Buck](https://weberworkshops.com/products/buck?variant=42334899666997)                                   | $150  | Their compatibility states that the Buck locks too far left on the LM Linea Micra & Mini, interfering with the steam wand. |
| Sworks          | [Adjustable Portafilter](https://sworksdesign.com/Adjustable-Portafilter-p616478019)                      | $165  | States compatibility with La Marzocco machines                                                                             |
| Canal           | [Hummingbird](https://canalseattle.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopFLY1CfnkCjQAxaRIu7NUwCTUc6kvD7W0TWE0O5m03m3Gw4Xq9) | $180  | States compatibility with La Marzocco machines                                                                             |

# My choice
I ruled out the Hummingbird pretty quickly since, despite being the most expensive, is mostly made out of plastic. It's also good looking as the other two options, in my opinion.

I've initially ordered the Sworks option, but the reduced cup clearance and poor visibility of the bottom of the basket are deal breakers for me.

I've now ordered the Weber Buck to see if this is a better option.

## Other options
* normcore make a tamper that so recommend for lay-flat needs, but as [this video](https://youtu.be/tveJdTqmS9E?si=fNOs-6t9hblgj3Xw) shows, itâ€™s not very stable as a lay-flat
# Sworks Adjustable Portafilter
## Pros
1. **Truly lay-flay** â€“ Square handle and completely level base makes it truly lay-flat and very stable
2. **Satisfyingly light** â€“ Super lightweight, which is surprisingly satisfying since itâ€™s usually heavier products that are satisfying. This feature also boasts faster heat up time.
3. **Perfect lock-in angle** (in theory) â€“ Handle angle can be rotated around the portafilter to achieve your desired handle lock angle
## Cons
1. **Heat is conducted down the handle** â€“ Iâ€™ve got fairly big hands and intuitively I grab the handle in a way that it fills my whole hand. Unfortauntely, the part of the handle that is close to the group head is too hot to hold, so I have to shift my hand back. Leading to the next pointâ€¦ 
2. **Handle could be longer** â€“ the handle can just about fill my hand, but due to the point above, I canâ€™t hold it in this way since my fingers get burnt. Itâ€™s fine to hold the handle without it filling your hand, but itâ€™s less comfortable, satisfying and reassuring when you lock in
3. **Range of rotation is too large with the stock Micra gasket** â€“ as I mentioned above, the perfect lock-in angle that this portafilter boasts is not the reality of using it with the Micra. This is because the range of motion when locking-in to the group is far too wide. If you adjust the handle angle to make the handle lock-in centrally at the 6 oâ€™clock position, you have to rotate the handle far too much to the left to insert it, which is really uncomfortable. If you compensate for this by angling the handle in the other direction, the entry angle becomes more comfortable but you lock-in way too close to the steam wand. A frequently reported solution to this is to buy a thicker gasket for your machine (see the section below on Thicker Gaskets). Iâ€™ve ordered a thicker gasket to test and will report back.
4. **You lose cup clearance** â€“ Since the portafilter drops down further from the group in order to ensure that it can lay-flat without the base of the basket bumping against the ground, you lose cup clearance. My favorite cappuccino cup does not fit between my Acaia Lunar and the Adjuatable Portafilterâ€¦ this could be a deal breaker for me since it adds another step to my workflow (pouring into a shot glass before my cap cup) and more washing up to doâ€¦ 
5. **Recessed basket makes it watch your bottomless pour** â€“ As mentioned in the point above, the Adjuatable Portafilter drops lower from the group than the stock Micra portafitier to ensure that the base of the basket doesnâ€™t prevent the portafilter from laying flat. This means that itâ€™s harder to watch your pour from the basket, which is the whole point of going bottomlessâ€¦

You can actually see what seems to be the blue cafelat gasket mounted to a Micra in [this instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DG8tYvtSAex/?img_index=1) from Sworks
